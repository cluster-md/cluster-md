the process of starting a node


1. load_bitmap(bitmap.c)

   1.1 read metedata from disk
   1.2 get CR of each bitmap.
       if get CR successfully
           call bitmap_add_avail_bitmap
       elif bitmap is occupied by other nodes
           try to get locking using async method
   1.3 bast of bitmap lock
       #FIXME
   1.4 when to execute load_bitmap
       #FIXME #TODO

2. raid1d( raid1.c)

   #FIXME when to run raid1d?

   raid1d is responsible to process the handler

   2.1 choose one bitmap from available list
       up-convert one bitmap lock to EX
   
   2.2 check if running nodes are blocking new start-up nodes.
       #TODO, release and require
   2.3 if received a message, process the handler.

3. md_do_sync (md.c)

   #TODO
